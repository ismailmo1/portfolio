Yelp Camp was the first website I made as part of a bootcamp. It implements CRUD functionality with MongoDB, and other standardfeatures you would see in a web app using the express framework.

I highly recommend checking out his [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) here, it covers the Express framework for nodeJS however it is a great introduction to web development principles in general.
