Yelp Camp was the first website I made as part of a bootcamp. It implements CRUD functionality with MongoDB, a cool looking integration with mapbox, and other standard features you would see in a web app.

I highly recommend checking out Colt Steele's [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) here, it covers the Express framework for nodeJS however it is a great introduction to web development principles in general.
