Tkinter GUI wrapper for pandas scripts

---

[Code](https://github.com/ismailmo1/financial-invoice)

Pandas is a fantastic library for working with data and it is one of the first python libraries I spent a lot of time with as I slowly started to replace Excel.
Despite all of it's awesome features and advantages over Excel, replicating my workflow for colleagues who didn't use python proved to be a challenge.

Spinning up a web server and deploying it via an API or a web app using something like Flask was beyond my capabilities at the time (and deployment on internal servers wasn't an option üôÅ)
but Tkinter made it fun and easy to wrap my scripts into desktop apps and distribute.
