Tkinter GUI wrapper for pandas scripts

Pandas is a fantastic library for working with data and it is one of the first python libraries I spent a lot of time with as I slowly started to replace Excel.
Despite all of it's fantastic features and advantages over Excel, sending my analyses to colleagues who didn't use python proved to be a challenge.

Spinning up a web server and deploying it via an API or a simple web app using something like Flask was beyond my capabilities at the time (and I doubt IT would've let me deploy on their servers anyways!)
but I did discover Tkinter and packaged up my scripts into fun little desktop apps.
