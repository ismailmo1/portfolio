[MES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_execution_system) is a genre of industrial software systems that tracks and documents the manufacturing process: from raw materials to finished goods.
During my time working in process engineering, a lot of my workflow involved wrestling with these systems to input and extract operational and quality data.

Hvaing some programming knowledge meant that clicking around the same menus looking for information was more painful than it should be, so I quickly got to work to start automating common tasks.

This evolved from quick and dirty jupyter notebooks to not so quick (but still dirty) notebooks and then eventually writing a module so I could reuse common functions and drastically reduce time it took to write scripts to collect data.
