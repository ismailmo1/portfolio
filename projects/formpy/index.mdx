Remember those multiple choice exams you did at school that were marked automatically by a "computer"?
Formpy emulates this workflow, letting you design your own forms and then automating the analysis.

Some ways in which it can be useful over online forms:

- Collecting OEE data in an ATEX environment at a manufacturing plant
- Gathering responses from an in person crowd where availability of devices isn't guaranteed
- Providing a proof of concept for data collection to prove value before committing to investment in technology
- Working with a non-tech savvy group who just prefer old-school pen and paper
- Online forms aren't flexible enough to create the exact form you want
